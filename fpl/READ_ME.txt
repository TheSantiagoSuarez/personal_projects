FPL Fantasy Wrapped

A personal project that uses the official Fantasy Premier League APIs to analyse and visualise the football fantasy league I was a part of with some friends.

This personal project involved data intake using the Fantasy Premier League APIs, pandas to organise all the data, and Streamlit to visualise it all.

Description of repository:
 > clean_csv - two main csv files gotten from fpl_data_intake.ipynb
 > findings - many findings csv files categorised into 4 different folders
 > pictures - pictures of the 8 people in the league
 > team_logos - pictures of the 20 PL teams
 
 > FPL_streamlit.py - Streamlit App File
 > fpl_data_intake.ipynb - file for data intake from the APIs
 > fpl_findings.ipynb - file answers different questions with GroupBys and exports them as csv files
 > requirements.txt
