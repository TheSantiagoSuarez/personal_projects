FPL Fantasy Wrapped

A personal project that uses the official Fantasy Premier League APIs to analyse and visualise the football fantasy league I was a part of with some friends.

This personal project involved data intake using the Fantasy Premier League APIs, pandas to organise all the data, and Streamlit to visualise it all.

Description of repository:
 > pictures - pictures of the people in the league
 > team_logos - pictures of the 20 PL teams
 
 > FPL_streamlit.py - Streamlit App File
 > fpl_data_intake.py - file for data intake from the APIs and saves them into a pickle file
 > fpl_findings.py - file answers different questions with GroupBys and saves them into a pickle file
 > requirements.txt

 > season_data.pickle - pickled data of a dictionary with all the relevant data from the API
 > seasons_findings.pickle - pickled data of a dictionary with all the relevant findings
