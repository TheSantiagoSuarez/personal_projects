The only thing better than a rich, fudgy brownie is a rich, fudgy brownie made with brown butter. These brown butter brownies have the most incredibly fudgy texture and that signature crackle top!

Brown Butter Brownies
Greetings, fellow brownie fiends. I’m here today with another tasty-delicious brownie recipe to satisfy your chocolate cravings: brown butter brownies. These brownies might be the best brownie I’ve ever eaten, which is saying a lot because I have consumed thousands. The brown butter adds a depth of flavor that takes these brownies to a whole new level and gives them the most irresistible fudgy texture. Plus, they’re easy to make and EVERYONE loves a brownie, so these are great for sharing with friends!

What are brown butter brownies?
Brown butter brownies are brownies made with brown butter instead of regular butter! The brown butter imparts a rich, nutty flavor that levels up your classic brownies in a subtle way. The brown butter flavor perfectly complements the rich chocolate. Some brown butter treats are really brown butter forward, but you’ll barely taste it here because the chocolate is a deeper, stronger flavor. The brown butter just adds this delightful depth of flavor that will make a homemade brownie taste even better.

Ingredients for brown butter brownies
While throwing together a boxed mix of brownies is obviously the easiest way to whip up brownies, homemade brownies are *so* worth the extra effort. And this homemade brownie recipe is actually pretty easy to make. You’ll need just 7 ingredients to whip up these super tasty, bakery worthy brownies. Here’s your grocery list.

Butter
Brown Sugar
Eggs
Cocoa Powder
Salt
Vanilla Extract
Flour


What is brown butter?
Brown butter, also known as beurre noisette in French, is butter that has been melted and cooked until the milk solids turn brown. As the butter cooks, the water evaporates and the milk solids begin to caramelize, giving the butter a nutty flavor and aroma.
How to make brown butter
Okay, so now we know what brown butter is, but like…how do you make it? Don’t worry–I’ve got your covered. To make brown butter, start by melting unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, continue to cook it, stirring occasionally, until it begins to turn golden brown and gives off a nutty aroma. Be sure to watch the butter closely, as it can go from brown to burnt very quickly. Once the butter is browned, immediately remove it from the heat to stop the cooking process.

What makes these brown butter brownies absolutely incredible
I hope you can tell just by looking at a photo of these bad boys that these brownies are absolutely delicious, but if the pictures aren’t doing them justice, I need you to know exactly why these brownies are out of this world tasty.

Brown Butter: The brown butter gives these brownies an extra edge that makes them taste seriously gourmet!
Bloomed Cocoa Powder: Mixing the cocoa powder into the browned butter instead of folding it in with the rest of the dry ingredients helps to really intensify the chocolate flavor and give these brownies and incredible fudgy texture.
High Sugar Content: Sugar keeps your brownies super soft in the center and gives them that perfect crunchy edge with just the right amount of chew.
Slightly Underbaked: Remember that baked goods continue to cook as they cool, so you’ll want your brownies to be slightly underbaked when you take them out of the oven so they don’t cool to an overbaked brownie!

Happy baking, friends! Enjoy!

Ingredients

3/4 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
3 large eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate) (optional)
 

Instructions



Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and line a 8 x 8-inch pan with parchment paper on all sides and set aside.
Place the butter in a small sauce pan and set over medium low heat. Low heat is key to an even, golden browning! Use a silicone spatula to stir and scrape the butter from the bottom and sides of the pan every 10 to 15 seconds. At first, the butter will melt and foam, then over time the foam bubbles will get smaller and the butter will begin to emit a warm, nutty aroma. Continue to cook the butter, occasionally stirring and scraping with your spatula, until the butter begins to take on color and you see small floating brown bits, about 10 to 15 minutes (these are the milk solids in your butter separating and toasting). Once the butter is golden brown, remove it from the heat.
Add the cocoa powder and vanilla to the brown butter and whisk to combine until no lumps of cocoa remain.
In a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs and brown sugar together until light, fluffy and pale in color.
Add the butter mixture to the egg mixture and use a rubber spatula to fold together.
Add the flour and the salt and fold the mixture until no streaks of flour remain. Last, fold in the chocolate chips, if using.
Transfer mixture into prepared baking pan and bake for roughly 25 minutes, testing for doneness by inserting a knife into the center of the brownies beginning at 20 minutes. You’ll know they’re done when the edge is set, but a knife inserted into the middle still comes out with a bit of brownie batter on it. It might take up to 35 minutes for them to cook through depending on your oven!

These are absolutely divine. I’m making my second batch now. I had to wait until midnight to run my oven because it’s so hot out today.  Was it worth it? Yes, ma’am:)

Delicious! I added a pinch of espresso and baked them in the bite-size muffing pan, it  took 18-20 min and made 33. I like to be able to freeze some for later 😀

I love this recipe! The first couple of times I tried this I didn’t really get a crinkly and shiny top, but after whisking the eggs for a bit longer (around 7 minutes) it turned out perfect 🤩. Will definitely continue to make this. I also did not have enough brown sugar so I also added some granulated sugar and it turned out perfect.
